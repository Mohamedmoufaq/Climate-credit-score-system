# Climate-credit-score-system
Traditional bank credit scoring systems primarily evaluate financial parameter such as income, repayment history, and credit score. However, they do not consider climate risks like floods, heatwaves, drought, and rainfall variability, which increasingly impact borrower stability and loan defaults—especially in climate-vulnerable regions of India.  
# 🌍 Climate Credit Score System

## 📌 Introduction
The **Climate Credit Score System** is a next-generation credit evaluation system that integrates **climate risk data** with traditional **financial credit scoring**.  
This project aims to help **banks, NBFCs, and financial institutions** make smarter and climate-aware lending decisions.

Traditional credit systems ignore climate-related risks, but climate change directly impacts repayment capacity.  
This system bridges that gap.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Current credit scoring models focus mainly on:
- Income
- Credit history
- Repayment behavior

### ❌ Missing Factor
They do **not** consider:
- Flood risk
- Drought risk
- Cyclones
- Heat stress
- Location-based climate vulnerability

As a result, lending decisions are **climate-blind** and risky.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution
The **Climate Credit Score System** introduces a **Climate-Adjusted Credit Score** by combining:
- Borrower financial data
- Location-based climate data
- Risk-weighted scoring logic

### ✔ Benefits
- Climate-aware lending
- Reduced default risk
- ESG-aligned credit decisions
- Future-ready banking system

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User provides location & financial inputs
2. System fetches climate risk indicators
3. Climate risk score is calculated
4. Credit score is adjusted using climate risk
5. Final risk category is generated:
   - Low Risk
   - Medium Risk
   - High Risk

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Flask Framework**
- **REST APIs**
- **Open-Meteo Climate API**
- **Statistical Risk Models**
